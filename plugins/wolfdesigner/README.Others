ideality: IDEA reprogrammed framework to build something like a designer,
can embedd Qt toolbars, not quite sure, if this is the way to go. Xinx
seems to use it.

Xinx is a good example of how to create your own plugin system as for
the paint example and as used for the visitors of Wolframe. Xinx looks
like extensions to Qt Designer, but isn't. It rather uses ideality to
form a similar IDE.
