- qtrans set when storing values over the form cursor
- how to create new dynamic properties, when they don't
  exist yet
- how to not set teh default action to the new action
  (e.g. keep the default edit action as "edit text")
- how to notify the property sheet that something has
  changed and how to trigger that (the cursor doesn't!)?
- property changes everytime but first time on a widget?
- doesn't work on Qt5!
